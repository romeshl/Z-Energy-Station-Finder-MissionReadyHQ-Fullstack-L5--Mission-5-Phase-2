# Intro

This app was built for **Mission 5 - Phase 2** at **Mission Ready HQ**. 

## Objective of the task
### THE PRODUCT 

Z Energy is a major New Zealand fuel distributor, offering high-quality fuel options alongside convenience retail services at its stations. The company is committed to delivering exceptional service and innovative solutions to meet the evolving needs of its customers, aiming to be the preferred choice for fuel and on-the-go purchases. 

### THE STORY 

Alex, a road trip enthusiast and freelance photographer, frequently travels across New Zealand to capture the country's stunning landscapes. To efficiently plan their journeys, Alex relies on the Z Energy website to locate gas stations and check fuel prices en route. However, Alex encounters difficulties using the station locator and fuel price features, which complicates trip planning. 

### THE PROBLEM 

Alex's challenges with the Z Energy website are echoed in customer feedback, highlighting the following concerns: 

"Trying to filter for stations that offer specific services like a car wash is frustrating. It should be easy, but it's not intuitive at all." 

"Why can't I see the fuel prices at different stations on the map? It would help me decide which one to visit based on price and location." 

"There's no way to quickly compare fuel prices across stations. I end up visiting multiple sites or calling the stations, which is time-consuming." 

"The site is a nightmare to navigate on my phone. Everything is so cramped, and I can't easily select what I need without zooming in and out repeatedly." 

### THE TASK 

Your objective is to redesign the Z Energy station locator and fuel price information pages to resolve the issues faced by Alex and other customers. The redesign should enhance the user interface to allow for easy location of gas stations based on specific criteria such as service offerings. Moreover, it should incorporate a clear and convenient way to view and compare fuel prices at different stations. 

Utilise Figma to develop your prototype, focusing on creating an intuitive and user-friendly design that improves navigation, filtering options and the visibility of fuel prices. Your presentation should detail the process you followed in identifying and addressing the key pain points, demonstrating how your redesign makes it easier for users like Alex to plan their travels efficiently. Highlight any innovative design elements or functionalities that contribute to a seamless and informative user experience on the Z Energy website.
